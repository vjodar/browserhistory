  Mozilla Firefox, or simply Firefox, is a free and <a href="https://opensource.org/">open-source</a> web browser
  developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, Mozilla Corporation. Firefox is officially available for
  Windows 7 or newer, macOS and Linux; its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating
  systems including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, illumos and Solaris Unix. Its sibling, Firefox for Android, is also
  available. Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web
  standards. In 2017, Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name Quantum to promote parallelism
  and a more intuitive user interface. An additional version, Firefox for iOS, was released on November 12, 2015.
