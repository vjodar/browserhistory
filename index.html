<h1>A history of browsers</h1>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>
  A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application that is able to access information on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web.</a> When a user tells the browser to visit a particular web page, the browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server, then displays the resulting web page on the user's device.

  A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are often confused. For a user, a search engine is just a website, such as Google Search, Bing, or DuckDuckGo, that stores searchable data about other websites. However, to connect to a website's server and display its web pages, a user must have a web browser installed.
