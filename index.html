<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>
  A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser) is a software application that is able to access information on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">World Wide Web.</a> When a user tells the browser to visit a particular web page, the browser retrieves the necessary content from a web server, then displays the resulting web page on the user's device.

  A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are often confused. For a user, a search engine is just a website, such as Google Search, Bing, or DuckDuckGo, that stores searchable data about other websites. However, to connect to a website's server and display its web pages, a user must have a web browser installed.

      Internet Explorer (formerly <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us">Microsoft</a> Internet Explorer and Windows
      Internet Explorer, commonly abbreviated IE or MSIE) is a series of graphical web browsers developed by Microsoft
      and included in the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, starting in 1995. It was first released as part
      of the add-on package Plus! for Windows 95 that year. Later versions were available as free downloads, or in
      service packs, and included in the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) service releases of Windows 95 and later
      versions of Windows. The browser is discontinued, but still maintained.

      Mozilla Firefox, or simply Firefox, is a free and <a href="https://opensource.org/">open-source</a> web browser
      developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, Mozilla Corporation. Firefox is officially available for
      Windows 7 or newer, macOS and Linux; its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating
      systems including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, illumos and Solaris Unix. Its sibling, Firefox for Android, is also
      available. Firefox uses the Gecko layout engine to render web pages, which implements current and anticipated web
      standards. In 2017, Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name Quantum to promote parallelism
      and a more intuitive user interface. An additional version, Firefox for iOS, was released on November 12, 2015.

      Google Chrome is a cross-platform web browser developed by <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>. It was
      first released in 2008 for Microsoft Windows, and was later ported to Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android. The browser
      is also the main component of Chrome OS, where it serves as the platform for web apps.

      Most of Chrome's source code comes from Google's open-source Chromium project, but Chrome is licensed as
      proprietary freeware. WebKit was the original rendering engine, but Google eventually forked it to create the
      Blink engine; all Chrome variants except iOS now use Blink.
